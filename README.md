# Shared Control Project Repo

## Description
This project is looking to see the effects of shared control on stop inhibition by creating an experiment 
which has the user control the height of a {} by using a pressure sensitive keyboard.

## Contents of repo:
The key components of this repor include:
experiment.py - the main experiment script to run the task
wooting_utils.py - contains the keyboard specific utility functions
schematics.py - not relevent, i believe this is a test verison or unfinished verison of exp
tweak_SSD_sampler.ipynb - notebook running simulations to test sample_SSD funciton in exp file

## To setup keyboard:
1. Follow the Wooting [quickstart guide](https://wooting.io/quickstart).
2. Install appropriate dynamic libraries (dylibs). 
    
    2.1 install [libusb](https://libusb.info/):
        `brew install libusb` 

    2.2 install [hidapi](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/hidapi):
        `brew install hidapi` 
    
    2.1 install [Wooting Analog SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk):
        `brew install wootingkb/wooting/wooting-analog-sdk`
or follow the instructions for manual installation on the Github Readme linked above.


## To run task:
